Brandify-Colorify
========

Extract colors from brand logos then filter and sort brands with their colors.

Visit http://scriptype.github.io/brandify/colorify for Colorify.

Needs to be run in the `localhost` environment as it uses ajax requests for getting json data.

Only thing to do for further development is watching/compiling `LESS`.
